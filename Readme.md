# Setting up a learning system

At first, I was just putting here some random stuff I was digging around the internet regarding programming, technology, concepts, etc. After a while, I realised that this would certainly be a mess when things started to grow big. I was just going to store plenty of code and text into a repository and eventually end up forgetting about it. The thing is that I really intend to learn new things and progress, but, unfortunately, in this crazy internet-driven world, a programmer simply can't just do that without making choices about what they want to learn. Time is a scarce resource and the amount of available content out there is huge.

After thinking about this a little, It came to me that what I really need is a system that can allow me to collect, categorize and prioritise all the stuff I absorb from the interwebs. This way will be easier to understand what I really want to do with my programming life by discovering what's most important and allocating the right time on what really matters to me.

## Where to start from

I am trying to start by :

* Understanding what are my information sources
* What is the kind of information I receive from these sources
* How they influence me? What values can they bring me? 
* How should I act in order to make the best use of the information that is available to me?
